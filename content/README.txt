This version of Jupyter is running inside your web browser. It allows you to try using Python and Jupyter, without installing anything on your computer.

You can use it to follow along with our training courses. There are some sample data files inside the "data" directory.

You can upload your own Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts or data files by dragging them into the file browser (on the left-hand side).

*** WARNING! ***
Anything you save inside this version of Jupyter is NOT STORED PERMANENTLY and may not be here when you come back.

You can download files to your own computer by right clicking on the file in the file browser (on the left-hand side) and choosing "Download".

We recommend that if you are using Python and Jupyter long term, you install them on your own computer.
